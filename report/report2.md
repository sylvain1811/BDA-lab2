# Raw results

The list of retrieved languages is the same independently from the method
which is used. This ascertainment seems logic since each attempt tries to
compute the same result changing only the way the computations are done.

The following table presents the result obtained, regardless of the attempt.

| Rank |  Language   |  # articles |
| :--: | :---------: | :---------: |
|    1 |    Java     |        2017 |
|    2 | JavaScript  |        1738 |
|    3 |     C#      |         850 |
|    4 |     CSS     |         555 |
|    5 |     C++     |         554 |
|    6 |   Python    |         545 |
|    7 |     PHP     |         452 |
|    8 |   MATLAB    |         324 |
|    9 |    Perl     |         300 |
|   10 |    Ruby     |         287 |
|   11 |    Scala    |         161 |
|   12 |   Haskell   |         128 |
|   13 | Objective-C |         112 |
|   14 |   Clojure   |          60 |
|   15 |   Groovy    |          55 |

Table: List of languages ranked by number of articles

\newpage

The analysis becomes more interesting when it targets the time of
computations. Here are the comparison of the three different attempts:

| Attempt name   | Time [s] |
| :----------:   | :------: |
| Naive          | 32125    |
| Inverted index | 5965     |
| Reduce by key  | 2847     |


# Interpretations

Let's try to understand these results one by one, beginning by the naive
implementation.

## Naive

For each language, the code go through the entire RDD and count
the number of articles containing its name. Therefore the computations are the
followings:

$$N * M$$

where:

- $N$ is the number of languages
- $M$ is the size of the RDD


## Inverted index:

For each language, the code has to calculate the size of its inverted index.
Therefore, the computations are the followings:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{N} size\ of\ inverted\ index\ i$$

where:

- $N$ is the number of Languages

Compared to the naive implementation, we don't have to go through the entire
RDD, and don't ever bother to check which article contains which language
because this information is already known.

## Reduce by key

TODO...


# Wikipedia-based VS RedMonk rankings

Finally, let's see how close is this Wikipedia-based ranking to the
popular RedMonk ranking. The list which was given in the Lab has been slightly
modified in order to match the one given here: [RedMonk ranking - June 2018](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/08/10/language-rankings-6-18/). Because the list has been "pre-filtered" to match the RedMonk one, only the order relationship is relevant here.


| Rank |  Wikipedia-based |  RedMonk    |
| :--: | :--------------: | :---------: |
|    1 |     C            | JavaScript  |
|    2 |     R            | Java        |
|    3 |     Java         | Python      |
|    4 |  JavaScript      | PHP         |
|    5 |     Go           | C#          |
|    6 |     C#           | C++         |
|    7 |     CSS          | CSS         |
|    8 |     C++          | Ruby        |
|    9 |    Python        | C           |
|   10 |     PHP          | Objective-C |
|   11 |     Ruby         | Swift       |
|   12 |    Scala         | Scala       |
|   13 |    Shell         | Shell       |
|   14 |  Objective-C     | Go          |
|   15 |   Swift          | R           |


- CSS, Scala and Shell are ranked in the same way
- Java, C# and C++ are one or two rank away from the RedMonk ranking

Even tough the ranking is note exactly the same, the general idea seems to
match pretty well the RedMonk rank.
